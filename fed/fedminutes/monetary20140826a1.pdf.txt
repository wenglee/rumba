the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on July 10, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the

July 28, 2014. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Richmond had voted on July 17, 2014, 
and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on July 24, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had 
voted on July 17, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and 
Dallas had voted on July 24, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 
3/4 percent).  At its meeting on July 14, the Board had taken no action on similar 
requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally noted improving economic conditions, 
and most directors expected the economy to continue expanding at a moderate pace. 
Consumer spending had picked up from earlier in the year, and some directors 
observed that auto sales were particularly strong.  Housing market activity was mixed. 
Directors reported increased home sales and prices in some areas, while other directors 
reported minimal loan activity and still-tight credit conditions in mortgage markets. 
Labor markets continued to show signs of gradual improvement, and the unemployment 
rate declined further.  However, many firms remained cautious about hiring and

continued to report difficulty finding qualified workers for certain positions.  Although 
some directors noted temporary increases in energy and food prices, directors generally 
did not see an increase in broader price pressures.  Longer-term inflation expectations 
remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of their outlook for economic and financial conditions, 
as well as their assessments of the risks to that outlook. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
