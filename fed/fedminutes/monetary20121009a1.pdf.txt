Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had voted on August 30, 2012, and the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on 
September 6 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston had voted on September 6 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a

decrease from 3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 
had voted on September 6 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 
3/4 percent).  At its meeting on August 27, the Board had taken no action on similar 
requests by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors remained cautious about the near-term 
prospects for economic growth, although most directors still expected economic 
conditions to improve over the longer term.  Some directors reported moderate growth 
in consumer spending, as well as strong performance in energy-related sectors. 
Directors also continued to note some positive developments in the housing sector, 
including a rise in home sales and prices.  However, some directors expressed concern 
about ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector and the adverse effects of the 
drought on agricultural production in some parts of the country.  Directors cited the 
persistence of downside risks, including strains in global financial markets and domestic 
fiscal and regulatory uncertainty, and their dampening effect on firms' hiring and 
investment decisions.  Inflation was generally seen as subdued.  Longer-term inflation 
expectations had inched up recently but remained stable overall.  Against this backdrop, 
most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1/2 percent), while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1 percent).  In part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread 
between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 75 basis points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in 
the pre-crisis discount rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke and Governors Duke, 

Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
