primary credit rate; requests by seven Reserve Banks to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
April 28, 2008. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on April 18, 2008, and the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco had voted on 
April 24 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate) of 2-1/4 percent (a reduction from 2-1/2 percent).  The directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had voted on April 24 to establish a primary credit 
rate of 2 percent.  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and 
Minneapolis had voted on April 17 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas had voted on April 24 to 
maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on April 14, the Board had taken no action on 
the requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco to lower the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of a 25-basis-point reduction in the 

primary credit rate expressed concern about near-term prospects for economic activity. 
Several directors noted that significant downside risks to economic growth remained, 
including the potential for a further weakening of labor markets and the possibility that 
the contraction in the housing sector would be deeper and more prolonged than 
currently expected.  Although some directors viewed the news on inflation as somewhat 
encouraging, they believed that challenges to price stability remained, and other 
directors were concerned about the implications for inflation of continued upward 
pressures on prices for food, energy, and other commodities.  Directors generally 
agreed that a further reduction of 25 basis points would appropriately balance the 
downside risks to growth with the upside risks to inflation. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors recommending a 50-basis-point reduction in the 

primary credit rate were also concerned about the risks to both growth and inflation. 
They considered it likely, however, that the greater economic slack associated with a 
slowdown in the real economy would moderate inflationary pressures.  These directors 
believed that a reduction of 50 basis points was appropriate at this point to reduce the 
risk of a serious downturn. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of maintaining the existing primary credit 

rate viewed concerns about the outlook for inflation as offsetting concerns about the 
subdued outlook for the real economy.  In part because of the significant lag before the 
full effects of past monetary policy easing would be realized, these directors concluded 
that no change in the existing rate was appropriate at this time. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 
preliminary basis, their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and its 
communication, which would be the principal subjects of the meeting of the Federal 
Open Market Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the 
primary credit rate before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was 
maintained.

and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Reduction in the primary credit rate from 
2-1/2 percent to 2-1/4 percent. 

Approved. 
April 30, 2008. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on April 18, 2008, and the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco had voted on 
April 24 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate) of 2-1/4 percent (a reduction from 2-1/2 percent).  The directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had voted on April 24 to establish a primary credit 
rate of 2 percent.  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and 
Minneapolis had voted on April 17 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas had voted on April 24 to 
maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on April 28, the Board had taken no action on 
these requests to lower the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 25-basis-point reduction, and 

the Board approved a reduction in the primary credit rate from 2-1/2 percent to 
2-1/4 percent, effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, 
Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco.  Earlier today, the Federal Open Market 
Committee had decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points 
to 2 percent.  It was understood that a press release announcing the reductions in the 
two rates would be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 
on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2-1/4 percent, of the Board's approval. 
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining Reserve Banks established that rate and were 
informed of the Board's approval, effective April 30 for the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Chicago and Kansas City, and effective May 1 for the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas.)
