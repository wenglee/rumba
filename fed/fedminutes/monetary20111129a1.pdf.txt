directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Atlanta, and Chicago had voted on 
September 29 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on September 29 to establish a rate of 
1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on September 19, the Board 
had taken no action on requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and

Market Committee.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted modest gains in economic activity, but 
they were circumspect about the outlook and expected that economic growth would 
continue to be slow and uneven over the coming quarters.  Some directors reported that 
consumer spending and retail sales had been somewhat stronger than anticipated, 
despite a generally low level of consumer confidence.  Some directors also noted 
moderate to strong improvements in other sectors, such as manufacturing and 
agriculture.  However, directors continued to express concerns about weakness in labor 
markets and the still-depressed housing sector.  In addition, many directors said 
ongoing uncertainty about such matters as global financial markets, U.S. regulatory and 
fiscal policies, and general economic conditions had caused consumers and businesses 
to remain cautious and to limit increases in spending and economic activity.  Higher 
prices for energy and other commodities had pushed up inflation earlier this year, but 
these prices subsequently receded or leveled off.  Longer-term inflation expectations 
have remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the 
current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.
