Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had voted on March 5, and the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas had voted on March 12, to

of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally judged that the economy had been 

expanding moderately.  Overall, reports on economic activity were mixed, due in part to 
severe winter weather.  Most directors regarded the positive effect of recent energy-
price declines on consumer spending as smaller than expected, although some of them 
reported strong auto sales, particularly for SUVs and trucks.  Many directors noted that 
export growth was slowing.  Labor market conditions had improved further, and 
directors reported strong job growth.  Although several directors cited recruiting 
difficulties as well as emerging wage pressures for some jobs, increases in broad 
measures of nominal wages generally remained modest.  Inflation continued to run 
below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective, reflecting in part lower energy prices 
and other transitory factors.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that 
the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis 
points (to 1 percent), while other directors favored reducing the rate by 25 basis points 
(to 1/2 percent).  The directors requesting an increase, which would widen the spread 
between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 75 basis points, favored a move toward normalization of the primary credit 
rate in light of their outlook for economic and financial conditions as well as the risks to 
that outlook.  Those directors favoring a reduction in the primary credit rate believed that 
a lower setting would be appropriate in light of the possible risks to the attainment of the 
Federal Reserve's inflation objective. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
