Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis had voted 
on April 17, 2014, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, 
Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on April 24, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had 
voted on April 17, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and 
Dallas had voted on April 24, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 
3/4 percent).  At its meeting on April 14, the Board had taken no action on similar 
requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted recent improvements in economic activity 

following a slowdown earlier in the year because of severe winter weather.  Overall, 
most directors expressed positive views that the economy would continue to expand at 
a moderate pace.  While consumer spending had started to pick up, some directors 
cited uneven activity across income groups.  Some directors also reported increased 
construction activity, particularly for commercial and multifamily residential projects. 
Commercial lending had expanded moderately, but residential lending continued to slow 
for both purchases and refinancings.  Recent labor market indicators had been 
moderately encouraging, but businesses were still cautious about hiring, and

unemployment remained elevated.  Some directors continued to report difficulty in 
finding qualified workers for certain positions.  Although prices for food and other 
commodities had increased recently, directors did not note a change in longer-term 
inflation expectations, which had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most 
directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen and Governors Tarullo, Stein,

 and Powell.
