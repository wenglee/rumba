Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on September 11, 2008, to 
establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary 
credit rate) of 2-1/2 percent (an increase from 2-1/4 percent).  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis had voted on 
September 4 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on 
September 11 to maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on September 2, the Board 
had taken no action on requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and 
Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of maintaining the existing primary credit 

rate noted downside and upside risks in the economic outlook.  Some directors 
concluded that declining real consumer spending had recently diminished the prospects 
for economic growth, while others pointed to increased weakness in the labor market 
and lower growth prospects among international trading partners as suggesting 
downside risks to growth.  Several directors also noted that tight credit conditions and 
the ongoing housing contraction served to intensify downside risks.  At the same time, 
directors remained concerned by the upside risks to inflation.  In these circumstances, 
they preferred to monitor developments closely for now before recommending a change 
in the stance of monetary policy. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors supporting a 25-basis-point increase in the 

primary credit rate recognized the downside risks to the economic outlook. 
Nevertheless, they believed that these risks were outweighed by increasing inflation 
risks and the danger of higher inflation expectations, and they favored removing some 
of the current policy accommodation. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be the subject of the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Duke.
