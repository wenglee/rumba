Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, and St. Louis had voted on 
October 16, 2014, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, 
Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on October 23, 
to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the 
primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Kansas City had voted on October 16, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Philadelphia and Dallas had voted on October 23, to establish a rate of 
1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on October 6, the Board had 
taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, 
Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally noted ongoing improvements in 

economic activity, and they expected continued moderate economic growth.  Some 
directors reported consumer spending had improved, although others cited uneven 
activity across income groups.  Directors reported a strengthening in nonresidential and 
multifamily construction, while reports on residential real estate activity were mixed. 
The unemployment rate had declined recently, but a range of indicators suggested 
slack remained in labor markets.  Nonetheless, some firms reported difficulty finding 
workers across various skill levels.  Several directors expressed concerns about

potential risks to the foreign economic outlook.  Inflation continued to run below the 
Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective.  Against this backdrop, most directors 
recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of their outlook for economic and financial conditions, 
as well as their assessments of the risks to that outlook. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
