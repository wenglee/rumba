September 24, 2012. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas had voted 
on September 13, 2012; the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
had voted on September 14; and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New 
York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago had voted on September 20 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate). The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of

3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on

meeting on September 10, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis had voted on 
October 11, 2012; the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had voted on 
October 17; and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on October 18 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston had voted on October 11 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 
3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on 
October 11 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its 
meeting on September 24, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted that economic activity in specific sectors 

had been mixed, and directors generally maintained their outlook for moderate 
economic growth over the coming months.  Most directors observed further signs of 

Page  2 

recovery in the housing sector, including growth in construction and sales, although the 
recent improvements were from low levels of activity.  Several directors also reported 
that consumer spending had picked up, most notably for automobiles, and some 
directors said performance in the energy and agricultural sectors had remained strong. 
Manufacturing activity, however, was generally judged to have weakened.  Directors 
noted that businesses continued to be cautious about hiring and investing, largely in 
response to domestic fiscal and regulatory uncertainty and downside risks associated 
with strains in global financial markets.  Aside from some recent increases in energy 
prices, inflation was generally seen as subdued.  Longer-term inflation expectations 
remained stable overall.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the 
current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1/2 percent), while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1 percent).  In part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread 
between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 75 basis points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in 
the pre-crisis discount rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place.  (NOTE:  Vice Chair Yellen was not present for this 
discussion.)

Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
