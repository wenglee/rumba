DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Reduction in the primary credit rate from 
3-1/4 percent to 2-1/2 percent. 

Approved. 
March 18, 2008. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco had voted on March 17, 2008, 
and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on March 18 to 
establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary 
credit rate) of 2-1/2 percent (a reduction from 3-1/4 percent).  The Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago had voted on March 17 to establish a primary credit rate of 
2-3/4 percent. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of a 75-basis-point reduction expressed 

concerns about the further deterioration in financial conditions and the economic 
outlook.  For some, economic prospects were unusually uncertain, and they believed 
that considerable downside risks to the economy remained and, for now, outweighed 
the upside risks to inflation.  Under these circumstances, directors generally agreed that 
an appreciably more accommodative stance for monetary policy was warranted. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 75-basis-point reduction, and 

the Board approved a reduction in the primary credit rate from 3-1/4 percent to 
2-1/2 percent, effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New 
York, and San Francisco.  Earlier today, the Federal Open Market Committee had 
decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. 
It was understood that a press release announcing the reductions in the two rates would 
be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 
on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2-1/2 percent, of the Board's approval. 
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining Federal Reserve Banks established that rate and 
were informed of the Board's approval, effective March 18 for the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas; effective March 19 for the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis; and effective 
March 20 for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
