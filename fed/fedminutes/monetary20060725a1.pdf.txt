DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by ten Reserve Banks to increase 
the primary credit rate; requests by two Reserve Banks to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
June 26, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors 
of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on 
June 15, 2006, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas had voted on June 22 to establish a 
rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) 
of 6-1/4 percent (an increase from 6 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Kansas City and San Francisco had voted on June 22 to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate generally viewed recent 

economic data as indicating a modest deceleration in economic activity.  They 
concluded, however, that additional monetary policy tightening was appropriate to 
address possible inflationary pressures, which in the view of some directors were partly 
attributable to elevated resource utilization. 

Directors in favor of maintaining the current primary credit rate believed that more 

time was needed to assess the outlook for both economic growth and inflation. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 
rate before the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week, and the 
existing rate was maintained. 
Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 

and Governors Bies, Warsh, and Kroszner.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Increase in the primary credit rate from 
6 percent to 6-1/4 percent. 

Approved. 
June 29, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors 
of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on 
June 15, 2006, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas had voted on June 22 to establish a 
rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) 
of 6-1/4 percent (an increase from 6 percent).  At its meeting on June 26, the Board had 
considered, but had taken no action on, the requests to increase the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 25-basis-point increase, and the 

Board approved an increase in the primary credit rate from 6 percent to 6-1/4 percent, 
effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas, and effective June 30 
for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  At an earlier meeting today, the Federal 
Open Market Committee had decided to increase its target for the federal funds rate by 
25 basis points to 5-1/4 percent.  It was understood that a press release announcing the 
increases in the two rates would be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 
on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 6-1/4 percent, of the Board's approval.  
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining two Reserve Banks established that rate and 
were informed of the Board's approval, effective June 29 for the Federal Reserve Bank 
of San Francisco and effective July 6 for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.) 
Voting for this action:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, and 

Governors Bies, Warsh, and Kroszner.
