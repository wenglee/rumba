DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by two Reserve Banks to increase 
the primary credit rate; requests by ten Reserve Banks to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
August 7, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond had voted on July 27, 2006, and the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had voted on August 3 to establish a rate for 
discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) of 6-1/2 
percent (an increase from 6-1/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco had 
voted on July 27, the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and 
Minneapolis had voted on August 3, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
St. Louis had voted on August 4 to maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on July 24, 
the Board had considered, but had taken no action on, a similar request by the 
Richmond Reserve Bank to increase the primary credit rate. 

Directors who preferred to maintain the existing primary credit rate at this time 
pointed to slower economic growth, the lagged effects of monetary policy actions, and 
the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.  Nevertheless, inflation pressures 
remained a concern for most directors, and they generally agreed that incoming data 
would be crucial in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward. 

Directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate noted that, while growth 
had slowed, it remained solid.  In this light, they appeared to view the risk that inflation 
pressures would persist as outweighing the risk of a sharp deceleration in economic 
activity. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 

rate before tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and the existing 
rate was maintained. 
Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 


and Governors Bies, Warsh, and Kroszner.
