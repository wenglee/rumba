Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis 
had voted on December 5, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco had voted on December 12, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had 
voted on December 5 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 3/4 percent). 
The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had voted on December 5, 
and the directors of Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on 
December 12, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its 
meeting on November 25, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to decrease, and by the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase, the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors offered generally positive reports on recent 

economic activity, and most directors were cautiously optimistic about the prospects for 
economic growth.  In general, directors reported gradual increases in consumer 
spending, although some higher-end retailers had experienced stronger gains.  Some 
directors cited notable strength in the auto sector, as well as some improvements in 
residential and commercial construction.  Activity in housing markets, on balance, had 
remained near recent levels.  Labor market conditions had improved, but the 
unemployment rate was still elevated.  Concerns about fiscal policy had diminished, but 
several directors commented on the potential effect of increased health care costs on 
hiring and economic activity more broadly.  Although recent inflation readings were 
lower than the Federal Open Market Committee's (the Committee's) longer-run goal, 
directors did not note a change in longer-term inflation expectations, which had 
remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent), 
while other directors favored reducing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent).  In 
part, those directors requesting an increase, which would widen the spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 
75 basis points, were interested in moving toward the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-
crisis discount rate structure.  Those directors favoring a reduction in the primary credit 
rate believed that a lower setting would help to foster the Committee's macroeconomic 
objectives of maximum employment and price stability. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the Committee's meeting this week.  No

sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate before the Committee's 
meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a discussion of economic 
and financial developments and issues related to possible policy actions took place. 
(NOTE:  Governor Raskin was not present for this discussion.)
