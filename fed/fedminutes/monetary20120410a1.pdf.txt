Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on 
March 8 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under 
the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston had voted on March 8 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease 
from 3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted 
on March 8 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its 
meeting on February 27, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted continued improvement in economic 

activity but remained cautious about the outlook, consistent with their expectations of 
growth at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Directors generally had positive, 
though uneven, reports on consumer spending.  Some directors had also observed 
increased capital spending by businesses and continued gains in manufacturing activity. 
The housing sector was still weak, despite some recent positive developments.  While 
most directors noted encouraging signs in labor markets, the elevated unemployment 
rate remained a source of concern.  Many directors also pointed to downside risks that 
included the potential for rising energy prices to reduce consumers' purchasing power 
while pushing up inflation temporarily, as well as the still-significant strains in global 
financial markets.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
primary credit rate be maintained. 

 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 
economic conditions as warranting either an increase or decrease in the primary credit 
rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent), 
while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent).  In 
part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread between the primary 
credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 75 basis 
points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-crisis discount 
rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
