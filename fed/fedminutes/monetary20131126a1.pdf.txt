October 7, 2013. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco had 
voted on September 26, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis had voted on October 3, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had 
voted on September 26 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 3/4 percent). 
The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on 
September 26, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had voted

meeting on September 16, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to decrease, and by the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase, the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond,

Federal Reserve Bank directors provided mixed reports on recent economic 

activity.  Many directors reported soft consumer spending, although some higher-end 
retailers had experienced gains.  Some directors saw improvements in the 
manufacturing and energy sectors.  Housing activity had slowed in some Districts, 
partially in response to higher interest rates.  Job growth was described as steady, on 
balance, although the unemployment rate remained elevated.  Overall, most directors 
continued to see downside risks to the outlook stemming from regulatory, fiscal, and 
other matters, and some expressed concern that unresolved fiscal issues, in particular, 
could continue to have a negative impact on economic activity.  Although recent inflation 
readings were lower than the Federal Open Market Committee's (the Committee's) 
longer-run goal, directors did not note a change in longer-term inflation expectations, 
which had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that 
the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent), 
while other directors favored reducing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent).  In 
part, those directors requesting an increase, which would widen the spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 
75 basis points, were interested in moving toward the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-
crisis discount rate structure.  Those directors favoring a reduction in the primary credit 
rate believed that a lower setting would help to foster the Committee's macroeconomic 
objectives of maximum employment and price stability. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the Committee's meeting this week.  No 
sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate before the Committee's 
meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a discussion of economic 
and financial developments and issues related to possible policy actions took place. 
(NOTE:  Governor Raskin was not present for this discussion.)
