DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Establishment without change by twelve 
Reserve Banks of the existing primary credit rate.

Existing rate maintained.
August 6, 2007.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago,
St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on July 26, 2007, and the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis had 
voted on August 2 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances 
(6-1/4 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).

Directors generally expected the economy to continue to expand at a moderate 

pace, supported in part by robust global economic conditions.  They noted that the 
U.S. housing market continued to contract and pose a downside risk to U.S. economic 
growth.  Several directors reported somewhat less accommodative financial conditions 
for some borrowers.  However, the economy overall was viewed as relatively healthy.  
Directors noted that the rate of inflation had continued to moderate but thought that its 
underlying trend remained unclear.  In that regard, some directors pointed to tightness 
in labor markets.  For now, directors preferred to maintain the current stance of 
monetary policy and to continue to evaluate the outlook for risks to both economic 
growth and inflation in light of incoming data.                          

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate before tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, 
and the existing rate was maintained.

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 
                                and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.
