 DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by two Reserve Banks to increase 
the primary credit rate; requests by ten Reserve Banks to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
September 19, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the 

directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Dallas had voted on 
September 14, 2006, to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate) of 6-1/2 percent (an increase from 6-1/4 percent).  
The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and 
Kansas City had voted on September 7, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on 
September 14 to maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on September 5, the Board 
had considered, but had taken no action on, a request by the Philadelphia Reserve 
Bank to increase the primary credit rate. 

Directors who preferred to maintain the existing primary credit rate cited both 

downside risks to economic growth, which arose mainly from the housing market, and 
upside risks to inflation, which resulted, in part, from some tightening in labor markets.  
They generally agreed that the current stance of monetary policy was in a range that 
was likely to achieve a tempering of inflation without endangering the economic 
expansion.  Directors noted, however, that incoming data would be crucial in 
assessments of appropriate policy adjustments going forward. 

Directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate considered current rates of 

core inflation to be uncomfortably high and the real federal funds rate as too low to 
provide assurance that core inflation would decline.  The recent moderation of economic 
growth, which resulted largely from the slow-down in the housing sector, and the recent 
decline in energy prices were seen as unlikely to lead to a significant reduction in 
inflation pressures.  

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit

rate before tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and the existing 
rate was maintained.
