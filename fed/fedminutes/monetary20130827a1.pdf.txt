credit rate.

Existing rate maintained.
July 1, 2013.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis
had voted on June 20, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of
Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco had voted on June 27 to reestablish
the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit
program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia had voted on June 20, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of
Kansas City and Dallas had voted on June 27, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an
increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on June 17, the Board had taken no action
on requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Kansas City to increase
the primary credit rate.

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its
communication, which would be discussed at the next meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee later this month.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the
primary credit rate before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was
maintained.  Thereafter, a discussion of economic and financial developments and
issues related to possible policy actions took place.

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke and Governors Duke,
                                Tarullo, Raskin, and Powell.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on July 18; and the directors of the
Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago,
Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on July 25 to reestablish the existing rate for
discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit
rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Kansas City had
voted on July 18, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had voted on
July 25, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting
on July 15, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve
Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate.

In general, Federal Reserve Bank directors saw economic activity as expanding
at a modest to moderate pace.  Most directors noted strengthening in the housing and
auto sectors, but their comments on manufacturing were mixed.  Employment had
continued to advance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated.  Overall, directors
continued to see downside risks to the outlook stemming from ongoing fiscal
constraints, the elevated unemployment rate, and uncertainty about employers' health
care costs.  Some directors also reported that the recent increase in long-term rates had
noticeably lowered residential mortgage refinancings and noted the possible effect of
higher rates on economic activity more generally.  Although recent inflation readings
were lower than the Federal Open Market Committee's longer-run goal, directors did not
note a change in longer-term inflation expectations, which had remained stable.
Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate
be maintained.

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent)
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions.

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible
policy actions took place.

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and
                                Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
