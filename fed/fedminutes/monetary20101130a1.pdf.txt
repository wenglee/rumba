Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago had voted on 
October 7, 2010, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on October 14 
to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the 
primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on October 14 to establish a rate of 
1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on September 20, the Board

and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis had 
voted on October 21, 2010, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco had voted on October 28 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Kansas City and Dallas had voted on October 28 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an 
increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on October 18, the Board had taken no 
action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally viewed the pace of economic recovery 

as slow, with unemployment rates too high and underlying inflation subdued.  While 
some directors reported slight gains in consumer spending or manufacturing activity, 
other directors described economic activity as flat and anticipated only a gradual 
improvement in activity in the near term.  The housing sector remained depressed, and 
some directors noted the potential for recently observed documentation irregularities in 
the foreclosure process to further delay the sector's recovery.  Labor markets remained 
weak.  A number of directors said that uncertainty about the strength of the economy 
and the government's fiscal and regulatory policies continued to weigh on hiring and

capital spending decisions.  Directors noted increases in some commodity prices, but 
with considerable slack seen in labor and product markets, inflation was expected to 
remain quite low.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
accommodative stance of monetary policy be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  It was emphasized that an increase in this spread 
would not represent a change in monetary policy, but rather a move toward 
normalization of the primary credit rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Warsh, Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
