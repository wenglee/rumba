Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, 
and Dallas had voted on June 6, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco had voted on June 13 to reestablish 
the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit 
program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia had voted on June 6, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City had voted on June 13, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from

the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

In general, Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed economic activity as 

continuing to expand at a moderate pace.  Most directors reported further improvements 
in housing and housing-related sectors, while recent data on consumer spending, 

Page  3 

manufacturing, and business investment were more mixed.  Some directors noted signs 
of improvement in labor markets, but the unemployment rate remained elevated. 
Overall, directors continued to see downside risks to the outlook from the elevated 
unemployment rate and ongoing fiscal constraints.  Although recent inflation readings 
were lower than the Federal Open Market Committee's announced target rate, directors 
did not note a change in longer-term inflation expectations, which had remained stable. 
Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate 
be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and

 Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
