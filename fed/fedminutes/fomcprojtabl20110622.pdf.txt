   NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the pre-
vious year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index 
for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the aver-
age civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate 
monetary policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under ap-
propriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The April projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee on April 26-27, 2011. 
   1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year. 
   2.  The range for a variable in a given year consists of all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year. 
   3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Explanation of Projections Charts 

 

The charts show actual values and projections for three economic variables: 
  Change in Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—as measured from 

the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the 
year indicated, with values plotted at the end of each year. 

  Unemployment Rate—the average civilian unemployment rate in the 

fourth quarter of each year, with values plotted at the end of each 
year. 

  PCE Inflation—as measured by the change in the personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE) price index from the fourth quarter 
of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated, with 
values plotted at the end of each year. 

 
Information for these variables is shown for each year from 2006 to 2013, 
and for the longer run. 
 
The solid line, labeled “Actual,” shows the historical values for each 
variable. 

The lightly shaded areas represent the ranges of the projections of 
policymakers.  The bottom of the range for each variable is the lowest of all 
of the projections for that year or period.  Likewise, the top of the range is 
the highest of all of the projections for that year or period. 

The dark shaded areas represent the central tendency, which is a narrower 
version of the range that excludes the three highest and three lowest 
projections for each variable in each year or period. 

The longer-run projections, which are shown on the far right side of the 
charts, are the rates of growth, unemployment, and inflation to which a 
policymaker expects the economy to converge over time—maybe in five or 
six years—in the absence of further shocks and under appropriate monetary 
policy.  Because appropriate monetary policy, by definition, is aimed at 
achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and 
price stability in the longer run, policymakers’ longer-run projections for 
economic growth and unemployment may be interpreted, respectively, as 
estimates of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate and the longer-
run normal rate of unemployment.  Similarly, the longer-run projections of 
inflation are for the rate of inflation that each policymaker judges to be 
most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate in the longer term.
