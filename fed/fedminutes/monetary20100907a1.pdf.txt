Federal Reserve Bank directors noted that recent economic conditions were 

indicative of a slower pace of recovery in output and employment than had been 
anticipated.  While some directors said that growth in certain sectors, including 
manufacturing, had been slightly higher than expected, others commented that 
consumer spending had softened somewhat.  The housing sector continued to be 
depressed, and labor markets remained weak.  Overall, directors anticipated only 
modest near-term economic expansion.  With inflation subdued and inflation 
expectations stable, most directors recommended that the current accommodative 
stance of monetary policy be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  It was emphasized that an increase in this spread 
would not represent a change in monetary policy, but rather a move toward 
normalization of the primary credit rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

 Warsh, Duke, and Tarullo.
