Federal Reserve Bank directors commented that economic activity appeared to 

be stabilizing, albeit at fairly  low levels, and that financial markets showed signs of 
recovery.  However,  household spending remained weak, and some directors 
considered it likely that poor labor market conditions, among other factors, would 
restrain consumption spending and dampen an economic recovery.  Directors also 
noted that considerable resource slack was continuing to inhibit capital expenditures. 
However, some directors were encouraged by indications that inventories were being 
brought under control.  Most directors deemed inflation to be subdued and likely to 
remain so for some time.  Under these circumstances, directors generally agreed that 
the current accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. 

Today,  Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary  basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating  in this  determination:  Chairman  Bernanke, Vice Chairman  Kohn, 

and  Governors  Warsh, Duke, and Tarullo.
