Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
San Francisco had voted on June 9, 2011, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis had voted on June 16 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas had voted on June 9 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City had voted on June 16 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 
3/4 percent).  At its meeting on June 6, the Board had taken no action on similar 
requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally noted that recent economic data had 
been weaker than expected, and they expressed a heightened caution about the likely 
pace of improvement in the economy over coming quarters.  Many directors said that 
recent increases in the prices of food and energy had damped consumer spending and 
sentiment.  Other directors expressed concern that uncertainty about fiscal and 
regulatory policies was weighing on business investment and hiring.  Unemployment 
was elevated, and the housing sector remained depressed, despite some activity in 
multifamily construction.  Several directors attributed the slower pace of recovery, in 
part, to factors that were likely to be transitory, but they expected the recovery would 
only be moderately strong even after those factors had dissipated.  Higher prices for 
energy and other commodities had recently pushed up inflation, but with commodity 
prices apparently stabilizing and longer-term inflation expectations stable, directors 
generally expected inflation to fall back.  Against this backdrop, most directors 
recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.
