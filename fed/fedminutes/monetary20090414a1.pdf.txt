Reserve Banks of the existing primary credit rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
March 16, 2009. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and 
Minneapolis had voted on March 5, 2009, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco 
had voted on March 12 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances 
(1/2Â percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate). 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally expressed concern about further 

weakness in economic conditions, and most cited the need for additional monetary and 
fiscal stimulus.  Some directors pointed to persistent tight credit conditions as exerting 
downward pressure on economic activity.  Others noted that the low level of consumer 
and business confidence was an important factor in reducing aggregate demand. 
Overall, they concluded that the downside risks to the outlook for growth and 
employment remained considerable, while inflationary pressures continued to be 
subdued.  Under these circumstances, directors believed that short-term interest rates 
should provide the greatest possible degree of stimulus, and they recommended 
maintaining the current primary credit rate.

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate in light of this week's 

meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.  No sentiment was expressed for 
changing the primary credit rate before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate 
was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 

and Governors Warsh, Duke, and Tarullo.
