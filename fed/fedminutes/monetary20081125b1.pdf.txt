September 29, 2008. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the 

directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had voted on September 25, 2008, to 
establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary 
credit rate) of 1-3/4 percent (a reduction from 2-1/4 percent).  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted 
on September 18 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on September 25 to 
maintain the existing rate.  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 
had voted on September 25 to establish a primary credit rate of 2-1/2 percent (an 
increase from 2-1/4 percent).  At its meeting on September 15, the Board had taken no 
action on a similar request by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Reduction in the primary credit rate from 
2-1/4 percent to 1-3/4  percent. 

Approved. 
October 7, 2008. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had voted on September 25, 2008, to establish a 
rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) 
of 1-3/4 percent (a reduction from 2-1/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on October 2 to 
maintain the existing rate.  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 
had voted on September 25 to establish a primary credit rate of 2-1/2 percent (an 
increase from 2-1/4 percent).  At its meeting on September 29, the Board had taken no 
action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Kansas City to 
change the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors supporting a 50-basis-point decrease in the 

primary credit rate believed that the downside risks to growth, particularly those 
resulting from tight credit conditions in financial markets and weakness in the labor 
market, were significant and believed that the upside risks to inflation were receding. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of maintaining the existing primary credit 

rate generally agreed that the economic outlook had weakened significantly over the 
last three months and that additional easing might be appropriate.  With conditions 
unsettled, however, these directors preferred no change in the stance of monetary 
policy at this time. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors supporting a 25-basis-point increase in the 

primary credit rate recognized the downside risks to the current outlook, but they 
continued to believe that these risks were outweighed by upside risks to inflation. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 50-basis-point reduction, and 

the Board approved a reduction in the primary credit rate from 2-1/4 percent to 
1-3/4 percent, effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  Earlier 
today, the Federal Open Market Committee had decided to lower its target for the 
federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent.  It was understood that a press 
release announcing the reductions in the two rates would be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 
on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 1-3/4 percent, of the Board's approval. 
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining Reserve Banks established that rate and were 
informed of the Board's approval, effective October 8 for the Federal Reserve Banks of 
New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas 
City, Dallas, and San Francisco, and effective October 9 for the Federal Reserve Bank 
of St. Louis.)

The Board approved renewal by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, 

Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis on October 2, 2008, of the formulas for 
calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under the secondary and 
seasonal credit programs and renewal of the auction procedure for determining the rate 
for the Term Auction Facility.

October 27, 2008. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco had voted on 
October 23, 2008, to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate) of 1-1/4 percent (a reduction from 1-3/4  percent). 
The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had voted on October 23 to 
establish a primary credit rate of 1-1/2 percent.  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City had voted on October 16, the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis and Minneapolis had voted on 
October 22, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Dallas 
had voted on October 23 to maintain the existing rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of a 50-basis-point reduction in the 

primary credit rate pointed out that heightened stress in financial markets and 
considerable deterioration in the outlook for economic activity made a strong case for a 
substantial easing in the stance of monetary policy.  They also believed that inflationary 
pressures were likely to abate somewhat because of sharp declines in commodity 
prices and increased economic slack.  Directors favoring a 25-basis-point decrease in 
the primary credit rate also expressed concern about slowing economic activity but, in 
view of lingering concerns about inflation risks, recommended a smaller reduction in the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of maintaining the existing rate also 

noted that economic activity appeared to have weakened as stress in financial markets 
had increased.  They believed, however, that the recent reduction in the primary credit 
rate and the extraordinary actions taken to recapitalize banks and foster liquidity in 
financial markets had not had enough time to take effect.  They concluded that no 
change in the existing rate was appropriate at this time. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be the subject of the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.
