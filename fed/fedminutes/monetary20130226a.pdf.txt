the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
and Minneapolis had voted on January 3, 2013, and the directors of the Federal

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis had voted 
on January 17, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on January 24 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston had voted on January 24 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 
3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on 
January 17 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its 
meeting on January 14, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

In general, Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed the pace of economic growth 

as modest.  Some directors noted continued improvement in the housing sector and 
increases in consumer spending.  However, unemployment remained elevated, and 
ongoing fiscal and regulatory uncertainties continued to weigh on business investment 
and hiring and on economic growth more generally.  Directors continued to see 
downside risks to the outlook, although some saw the risks as being diminished.  Apart 
from fluctuations in prices for oil and other commodities in recent months, inflation was 

Page  2 

seen as subdued.  Longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  Against this 
backdrop, most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be 
maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1/2 percent), while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1 percent).  In part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread 
between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 75 basis points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in 
the pre-crisis discount rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place.  (NOTE:  Vice Chair Yellen was not present for this 
discussion.) 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
