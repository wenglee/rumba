Federal Reserve Bank directors noted recent economic indicators suggesting a 
slow and uneven pace of recovery in output and employment.  Some directors said that 
manufacturing activity and consumer spending had improved somewhat, but directors 
generally pointed to signs of softness in economic activity.  The housing sector 
continued to be depressed, and labor markets remained weak.  Several directors noted 
that uncertainty about the strength of the economy as well as fiscal and regulatory 
policies was weighing on capital spending and hiring.  A number of directors reported 
that the pace of the recovery had slowed in recent months.  With inflation subdued and 
inflation expectations stable, most directors recommended that the current 
accommodative stance of monetary policy be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  It was emphasized that an increase in this spread 
would not represent a change in monetary policy, but rather a move toward 
normalization of the primary credit rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

Duke, and Tarullo.
