Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and 
San Francisco had voted on April 12, 2012, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on 
April 19 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under 
the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston had voted on April 12 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 
3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on 
April 12 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting 
on April 2, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted further improvement in economic activity, 

and they anticipated growth would continue at a moderate pace.  Directors generally 
saw the incoming data on consumer spending as a bit more robust than they had 
expected but cautioned that these gains might be attributable to unseasonably warm 
winter weather.  Directors also reported strong performance in sectors related to 
agriculture and motor vehicles.  Some directors noted improvement, albeit gradual and 
from low levels, in the housing sector that was particularly apparent in multifamily 

Page  2 

housing.  While hiring had picked up recently, the unemployment rate remained 
elevated.  Some directors noted that higher energy prices were damping consumer 
spending on non-energy products.  Many directors cited downside risks that included 
still-significant strains in global financial markets and ongoing domestic fiscal 
uncertainty.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 
economic conditions as warranting either an increase or decrease in the primary credit 
rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent), 
while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent).  In 
part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread between the primary 
credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 75 basis 
points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-crisis discount 
rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
