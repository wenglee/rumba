Francisco had voted on May 22, 2014, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of New York, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis had voted on May 29, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program

Dallas had voted on May 22, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia had voted on May 29, to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 
3/4 percent).  At its meeting on April 28, the Board had taken no action on similar 
requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis had voted on June 5, 
2014, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, 
Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on June 12, to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, 
Kansas City, and Dallas had voted on June 12 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an 
increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on June 2, the Board had taken no action on 
similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas 
to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted ongoing improvements in economic 

activity, and most directors expected the economy to continue expanding at a moderate 
pace.  Consumer spending remained on a moderately upward trend, particularly in large 
metropolitan areas and at higher-end retailers.  Many directors also described 
manufacturing as either holding steady or picking up gradually.  Housing market activity 
was generally slow, although some areas reported increased activity.  Labor markets 
showed further signs of improvement, but most firms were still cautious about hiring, 
and the unemployment rate remained elevated.  Directors generally did not report an 
increase in price pressures or note a change in longer-term inflation expectations, which

had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the 
current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of their outlook for economic and financial conditions, 
as well as their assessments of the risks to that outlook. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
