DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Establishment without change by twelve 
Reserve Banks of the existing primary credit rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
March 19, 2007. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the 

directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on March 8, 2007, and the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and 
Kansas City had voted on March 15 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and 
advances (6-1/4 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate). 

Most directors expected the overall economy to continue to expand at a 

moderate pace in the coming months, although they recognized that activity in the 
housing sector was likely to continue to contract as inventories of unsold homes were 

worked down.  Several directors noted that there appeared to be some reversal of the 
previous moderating trend in core inflation, and a few considered the recent 
higher-than-expected increases in inflation somewhat disappointing.  Other directors 
concluded that the underlying trend for inflation was unclear at this time.  They generally 
agreed that the current stance of monetary policy should be maintained pending further 
developments.

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the

and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.
