December 15, 2014. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis 
had voted on December 4, 2014, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on December 11, to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia had voted on December 4, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on December 11, to establish a rate of 1 percent 
(an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on November 24, the Board had taken no 
action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, 
and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors continued to note improvements in economic 

conditions, and they generally were more confident about economic growth going 
forward.  Directors reported an increase in consumer spending, including brisk auto 
sales in some Districts, and commented that lower energy prices could potentially boost 
spending further.  Some directors also observed modest gains in residential real estate 
activity and stronger growth in commercial lending and construction.  Other directors, 
however, regarded foreign economic developments as a potential risk to domestic 

Page  2 

economic activity.  Overall, labor market conditions had improved, and several directors 
noted emerging wage pressures, particularly for jobs with specialized skills. 
Nonetheless, inflation continued to run below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective, 
in part because of recent declines in energy prices.  Against this backdrop, most 
directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of their outlook for economic and financial conditions, 
as well as their assessments of the risks to that outlook. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
