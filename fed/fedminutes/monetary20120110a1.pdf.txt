Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had voted on November 9, 2011; the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San 
Francisco had voted on November 10; and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on 
November 17 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on November 10 to establish a rate of 
1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on October 31, the Board had

increase the primary credit rate.

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the next meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of maintaining the primary credit rate 

generally noted moderate growth in overall economic activity.  Although the outlook had 
improved somewhat, directors expected that growth would continue to be gradual and 
uneven over the coming quarters.  Several directors reported further gains in consumer 
spending and retail sales.  Conditions in the labor and housing markets were still a 
source of concern, despite some hiring activity and positive reports about sales and 
construction in the multifamily sector.  In addition, many directors indicated that 
uncertainty about global financial markets, the economic outlook, and U.S. regulatory 
and fiscal policies was contributing to ongoing caution and restraint on the part of 
consumers and businesses.  Inflationary pressures had eased from earlier in the year, 
and longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, 
most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

Other Federal Reserve Bank directors favored changing the primary credit rate. 

On the one hand, some directors supported decreasing the primary credit rate by 
25 basis points (to 1/2 percent) as a technical adjustment to better align the rate with 
the recently reduced charges on the Federal Reserve's dollar liquidity swap 
arrangements with major foreign central banks.  On the other hand, some directors 
supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent), and the 
spread between the rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate 
to 75 basis points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-
crisis discount rate structure.  Directors also pointed to current and anticipated 
economic conditions as reasons to decrease or increase the primary credit rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.
