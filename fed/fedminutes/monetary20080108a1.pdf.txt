DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by ten Reserve Banks to lower  the 
primary credit rate; requests by two Reserve Banks to maintain the existing rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
December 10, 2007. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had voted on November 30, 2007, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and St. Louis had voted on December 5, the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland had 
voted on December 6, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago had 
voted on December 7 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate) of 4-3/4 percent (a reduction from 5 percent).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had voted on November 29 and 
the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco had voted on 

December 6 to establish a primary credit rate of 4-1/2 percent.  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on November 29 and the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had voted on December 6 to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of reducing the primary credit 

rate by 25 basis points generally agreed that the downside risks to economic growth 
had increased and that conditions in financial markets had recently deteriorated.  Some 
directors thought that a reduction in the primary credit rate might improve liquidity in the 
interbank term funding market.  In light of the financial market situation and other factors 
affecting economic prospects, these directors concluded that reducing the primary credit 
rate to 4-3/4 percent would be sufficient at this time. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of a 50-basis-point reduction 

expressed similar concerns.  They believed, however, that financial market conditions 
and the economic outlook necessitated a larger reduction in order to provide some 
insurance against a more serious economic downturn.  Accordingly, they supported a 
primary credit rate of 4-1/2 percent. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors who preferred to maintain the current primary 
credit rate of 5 percent considered the incoming evidence of a slowdown in economic 
growth to be within their expectations and viewed the re-pricing of credit to be a 
necessary adjustment.  In the absence of new material information, they considered 
concerns about a slowdown in economic activity to be offset by continued inflation 
pressures and judged that an unchanged primary credit rate was appropriate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate before tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, 
and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 

and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.

Approved. 
December  11, 2007. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had voted on November 30, 2007, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and St. Louis had voted on December 5, the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland had 
voted on December 6, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago had 
voted on December 7 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate) of 4-3/4 percent (a reduction from 5 percent).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had voted on November 29 and 
the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco had voted on 
December 6 to establish a primary credit rate of 4-1/2 percent.  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on November 29 and the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had voted on December 6 to maintain the existing 
rate.  At its meeting on December 10, the Board had taken no action on the requests to 
lower the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 25-basis-point 

reduction, and the Board approved a reduction in the primary credit rate from 
5 percent to 4-3/4 percent, effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks 

of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago and effective 
December 12 for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Earlier today, the Federal 
Open Market Committee had decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 
25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent.  It was understood that a press release announcing the 
reductions in the two rates would be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 
on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 4-3/4 percent, of the Board's approval. 
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining Reserve Banks established that rate and were 
informed of the Board's approval, effective December 11 for the Federal Reserve Bank 
of San Francisco, effective December 12 for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, 
Minneapolis, and Dallas, and effective December 13 for the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City.)
