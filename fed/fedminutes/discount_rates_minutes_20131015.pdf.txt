the existing rate and requests by three Reserve Banks to increase the primary 
credit rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
August 12, 2013. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on August 1, 2013, and the directors 
of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on August 8 to reestablish the 
existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Banks of Philadelphia and Kansas 
City had voted on August 1, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas 
had voted on August 8 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent). 
At its meeting on July 29, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the primary 
credit rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the next meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee in September.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the 
primary credit rate before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was 
maintained.  Thereafter, a discussion of economic and financial developments and 
issues related to possible policy actions took place.  (NOTE: Governor Duke was not 
present for this discussion.) 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and

 Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, and Stein.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had voted on September 4, 2013; the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond had voted on September 10; and the directors 
of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
San Francisco had voted on September 12 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts 
and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had voted on September 12 to 
establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 3/4 percent).  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had voted on September 5, and the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on September 12 to 
establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on 
August 26, the Board had taken no action on requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors mostly saw economic activity as expanding at a 

moderate pace.  Directors viewed recent readings on manufacturing activity and the 
housing and auto sectors as generally positive.  Consumer spending continued to 
advance, although reports suggested that some households remained cautious in their 
borrowing and spending behavior.  Some directors noted that the recent increase in 
long-term interest rates had dampened activity in housing markets, but others perceived 
that the recovery in housing markets had been largely unaffected to date by the rise in 
rates.  Although labor market conditions were viewed as improving, the unemployment 
rate remained elevated.  Overall, directors continued to see downside risks to the 
outlook stemming from ongoing domestic fiscal constraints and uncertainties, recent 
increases in long-term interest rates, and geopolitical concerns.  Although recent 
inflation readings were lower than the Federal Open Market Committee's (the 
Committee's) longer-run goal, directors did not note a change in longer-term inflation 
expectations, which had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors 
recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent), 
while other directors favored reducing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent).  In 
part, those directors requesting an increase, which would widen the spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 
75 basis points, were interested in moving toward the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-
crisis discount rate structure.  Those directors favoring a reduction in the primary credit

rate believed that a looser setting would help to foster the Committee's macroeconomic 
objectives of maximum employment and price stability. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the Committee's meeting this week.  No 
sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate before the Committee's 
meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a discussion of economic 
and financial developments and issues related to possible policy actions took place.
