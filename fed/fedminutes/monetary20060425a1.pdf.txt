DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by four Reserve Banks to increase 
the primary credit rate; requests by eight Reserve Banks to maintain the existing 
rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
March 13, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago had voted on 
March 9, 2006, to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit 
program (primary credit rate) of 5-3/4 percent (an increase from 5-1/2 percent).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and 
Kansas City had voted on March 2, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on March 9 to maintain the 
existing rate. 

Directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate generally gave positive 
assessments of the economy.  Some directors commented that business conditions 
were very good and that the general outlook had improved since the last quarter. 
Others noted that although economic activity appeared to be picking up pace, inflation 
pressures remained moderate.  In these circumstances, additional monetary policy 
tightening was seen as appropriate, particularly in light of the possibility that tightening 
labor markets might increase inflationary pressures. 

Directors requesting no change in the primary credit rate also viewed the 

economy as growing at a healthy pace with inflation relatively well contained.  Although 
most of these directors appeared supportive of a further tightening in monetary policy as 
needed, they preferred to wait for additional data before recommending action at this 
time. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 

rate, and the existing rate was maintained. 
Participating in this determination:  Governors Bies, Olson, Kohn, Warsh, and 

Kroszner.

The Board approved renewal by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, 
Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City on March 2, 2006, and by the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, 
and San Francisco on March 9 of the formulas for calculating the rates applicable to 
discounts and advances under the secondary and seasonal credit programs. 
Voting for this action:  Governors Bies, Olson, Kohn, Warsh, and Kroszner.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by eleven Reserve Banks to 
increase the primary credit rate; request by one Reserve Bank to maintain the 
existing rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
March 27, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Minneapolis had voted on March 16, 2006, 
and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on March 
23 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate) of 5-3/4 percent (an increase from 5-1/2 percent).  The directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on March 16 to maintain the 
existing rate.  At its meeting on March 13, the Board had considered, but had taken no 
action on, similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, and Chicago to increase the primary credit rate. 

Directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate generally cited recent data 

indicating solid economic growth in the first quarter and contained inflation.  Although 
most directors viewed the near-term outlook as favorable, some noted the potential 
upside risk to inflation pressures stemming from elevated energy prices.  Some 
directors regarded core inflation as approaching the upper limit of what was acceptable.  
In this light, further monetary policy firming was considered appropriate. 

Directors in favor of maintaining the primary credit rate for the time being viewed 
economic growth as near trend and inflation as modest, with some expressing concern 
about a slowdown in the housing market. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 

rate before the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later today and 
tomorrow, and the existing rate was maintained.

Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on March 
23 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program

5-3/4 percent, effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New 
York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and 
San Francisco, and effective March 29 for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  At an 
earlier meeting today, the Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase its 
target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.  It was understood 
that a press release announcing the increases in the two rates would be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Kansas City, on its establishment of a primary credit rate of 5-3/4 percent, of the 
Board's approval.  (NOTE:  Subsequently, the Reserve Bank established that rate and 
was informed of the Board's approval, effective March 30, 2006).
