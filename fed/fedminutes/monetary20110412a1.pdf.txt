Federal Reserve Bank directors generally viewed recent information as showing 

that the economic recovery was progressing.  Directors noted a number of positive 
indicators, including further gains in consumer spending, a modest improvement in labor 
market conditions, and continued advances in manufacturing activity.  Information about 
commercial construction activity was mixed, while the housing sector continued to 
struggle due, in part, to a high volume of foreclosures.  Directors expressed concerns 
about the downside risks posed by rising energy and other commodity prices and by 
increased fiscal stringency at all levels of government.  While rising commodity prices 
can exert upward pressure on inflation, most directors expected inflation to remain low 
over the medium term.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the 
current accommodative stance of monetary policy be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and

 Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
