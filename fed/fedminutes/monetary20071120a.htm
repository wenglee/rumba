A Summary of Economic Projections made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents is also included as an addendum to these minutes.
The minutes for each regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee ordinarily are made available three weeks after the day of the policy decision and subsequently are published in the Board’s Annual Report. Summaries of Economic Projections are released on an approximately quarterly schedule. The description of economic and financial conditions contained in these minutes is based solely on the information that was available to the Committee at the time of the meeting.
