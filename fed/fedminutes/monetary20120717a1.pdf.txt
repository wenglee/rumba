the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, 
and San Francisco had voted on May 24, 2012, and the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on May 31 to

communication, which would be discussed at the next meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee.  Board members also discussed economic and financial 
developments and issues related to possible policy options.  No sentiment was 
expressed for changing the primary credit rate before the Committee's meeting, and the 
existing rate was maintained.

and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on June 14 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston had voted on June 14 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 
3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on 
June 14 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting 
on June 4, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted relative weakness in recent economic data 

but generally expected moderate economic growth to continue over the coming 
quarters.  Some directors reported strong performance in sectors related to energy, 
agricultural products, and auto manufacturing and sales.  Some directors also noted 
positive developments in the housing sector, such as stabilizing prices and modest 
gains in residential construction.  Overall, directors saw consumer spending as having 
softened somewhat relative to earlier in the year.  In labor markets, the pace of gains in 
employment had slowed, and the elevated unemployment rate remained a source of 
concern.  Directors cited ongoing downside risks, including still-significant strains in 
global financial markets and domestic fiscal uncertainty, as resulting in heightened 
caution regarding hiring and investment.  Lower prices for energy and other 
commodities had led to a decline in inflation, and longer-term inflation expectations had 
remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 
economic conditions as warranting either an increase or decrease in the primary credit 
rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent), 
while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent).  In 
part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread between the primary 
credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 75 basis 
points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-crisis discount 
rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place.  (NOTE:  Vice Chair Yellen was not present for this 
discussion.)
