Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of

Page  2 

Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis had 
voted on June 18 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances 
(1/2 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate). 

Federal Reserve Bank directors expressed continued concern about the near-

term economic outlook.  While pointing to signs of some stabilization in economic 
conditions, most notably the slowing pace of decline in GDP, and to modest 
improvements in financial markets, they generally considered economic activity to be 
weak and the financial system to remain somewhat fragile.  Labor market conditions 
were described as difficult, and falling incomes and housing wealth were cited as 
potential obstacles to a near-term recovery.  Most directors expected inflation to remain 
subdued for some time, partly because of substantial economic slack.  Under these 
circumstances, directors generally agreed that the current accommodative stance of 
monetary policy remained appropriate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke and Governors Warsh,

 Duke, and Tarullo.
