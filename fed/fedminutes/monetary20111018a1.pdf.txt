Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on September 15 to establish a rate of 
1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on September 6, the Board had 
taken no action on a request by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase 
the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors remained cautious about the prospects for 

economic growth in light of generally weak incoming data on employment and 
production.  Although some directors reported improvements in certain sectors, 
particularly those related to energy or motor vehicles, most directors described overall 
economic activity as moderate or flat, and many saw the outlook as unusually uncertain. 
Several directors cited heightened caution and restraint by consumers and businesses 
as a result of recent volatility in stock prices, continued uncertainty about European and 
U.S. fiscal matters, and concern about general economic conditions.  Directors also 
noted the ongoing drag on the economy from sluggish employment growth and the still-
depressed housing sector.  Higher prices for energy and other commodities pushed up 
inflation earlier this year, but these prices had subsequently receded or leveled off. 
Longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most 
directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
