Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had voted on November 8, 2010; the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco had voted on

Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on November 18 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas had voted on November 10, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

December 13, 2010.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis had voted on 
December 2, 2010, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco had voted on 
December 9 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on December 9 to establish a rate 
of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on November 22, the Board 
had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City 
and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate.

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted positive developments that indicated the 
recovery was continuing, but given ongoing uncertainties, directors remained cautious 
about the outlook and expected growth to be modest going forward.  Directors reported 
somewhat stronger-than-anticipated consumer spending, with prospects for holiday 
sales brighter than in recent years.  Some directors said manufacturing activity had

continued to expand.  However, directors also pointed to continued weakness in certain 
sectors.  Housing remained depressed, with some directors observing that weak 
demand and elevated supply due to higher foreclosure activity was putting downward 
pressure on home prices.  Several directors noted that unemployment remained 
unacceptably high, although some directors also noted that initial claims for 
unemployment had trended downward in recent months.  Many directors commented 
that uncertainty about several matters, including the U.S. government's fiscal and 
regulatory policies, the fiscal condition of state and local governments, and financial 
developments abroad, continued to weigh on hiring and capital spending decisions.   
Directors also noted increases in certain commodity prices, such as those for metals 
and agricultural products, but they generally expected inflation to remain quite low.  
Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current accommodative 
stance of monetary policy be maintained.

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of the monetary stimulus already in place.

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 
                                Governors Warsh, Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
