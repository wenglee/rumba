the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco 
had voted on March 28, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis had voted on 
April 4 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under 
the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City had voted on March 28 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an 
increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on March 18, the Board had taken no action 
on a similar request by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

Existing rate maintained. 
April 29, 2013. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis had voted on 
April 18, 2013, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on 
April 25 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under 
the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City had voted on April 25 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase 
from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on April 8, the Board had taken no action on a similar 
request by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate. 

In general, Federal Reserve Bank directors continued to view the pace of 
economic expansion as moderate.  Several directors noted that recent data on 
economic activity had been mixed.  Many directors noted further improvements in the 
housing sector.  Job growth was described as modest, on balance, and the 
unemployment rate remained elevated.  Overall, directors continued to see downside 
risks to the outlook, and they expressed concern that unresolved fiscal issues could be 
restraining hiring and economic growth more broadly.  Inflation was seen as subdued, 
and longer-term inflation expectations generally had remained stable.  Against this 
backdrop, most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be 
maintained.

However, some directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis 

points (to 1 percent) at this time as a step toward restoring the pre-crisis discount rate 
structure.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the primary 
credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target range for 
the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization of the 
primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
