Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
San Francisco had voted on June 10, 2010, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis had voted on June 17 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas had voted on June 8 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City had voted on June 10 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 
3/4 percent).  At its meeting on June 7, the Board had taken no action on requests by 
the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted several indications that suggested a 

moderate economic recovery was continuing.  A number of directors commented that 
consumer spending had increased, albeit from low levels.  Nevertheless, directors were 
cautious about the outlook.  Although the labor market showed signs of gradual 
improvement, directors generally expected hiring to remain subdued.  Directors also 
expressed concerns about downside risks posed by the fiscal condition of state and 
local governments and by financial developments abroad.  In light of these persistent 
risks and the continued outlook for a gradual recovery, and with inflation subdued and 
inflation expectations stable, most directors recommended that the current 
accommodative stance of monetary policy be maintained. 

 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 

and Governors Warsh, Duke, and Tarullo.
