the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
St. Louis, and San Francisco had voted on March 24, 2011, and the directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on March 31 
to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the 
primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on March 24 to establish a rate of 1 percent 
(an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on March 14, the Board had taken no 
action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and 
San Francisco had voted on April 14, 2011, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis had voted on April 21 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Kansas City and Dallas had voted on April 14 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an 
increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on April 4, the Board had taken no action on 
similar requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas to increase 
the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally noted that although the economic 
recovery was progressing, they were cautious about the economic outlook.  Some 
directors reported increases in consumer and business spending; gains were also noted 
in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.  Labor market conditions had continued to 
improve modestly, although many directors said unemployment was still higher than 
desired.  The housing sector remained weak, and some directors noted that recent 
housing starts were lower than anticipated.  Other directors pointed to considerable 

Page  2 

slack remaining in the economy and ongoing downside risks to the economic outlook. 
Those risks included rising commodity and energy prices, which had the potential to 
dampen consumer spending, and increased fiscal stringency at all levels of 
government.  Higher energy and other commodity prices had recently pushed up 
inflation. This increase was generally not expected to be sustained, although a number 
of directors saw upside risks to the inflation outlook.  Against this backdrop, most 
directors recommended that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy be 
maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
