Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis had voted on 
July 19, 2012, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on July 26 to 
reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary

Page  3 

Boston had voted on July 26 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 
3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on 
July 19 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on 
July 16, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted that economic activity had slowed 

somewhat in recent months.  Most directors still expected economic conditions to 
improve over the medium term, although some expressed considerable uncertainty 
about the near-term prospects for economic growth.  In labor markets, growth in 
employment was sluggish, and the elevated unemployment rate remained a source of 
concern.  Directors reported solid increases in automobile sales, but overall consumer 
spending had decelerated somewhat.  Directors also noted continued, though uneven, 
improvements in the housing sector that included a rise in home sales and prices in a 
number of areas.  Some directors reported potentially adverse effects from recent 
drought conditions in many regions.  Directors cited ongoing downside risks, including 
still-significant strains in global financial markets and domestic fiscal uncertainty, as 
resulting in more caution on the part of firms regarding hiring and investment.  Lower 
energy prices had helped to hold down inflation, and longer-term inflation expectations 
had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the 
current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 
economic conditions as warranting either an increase or decrease in the primary credit 
rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1/2 percent), 
while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent).  In 
part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread between the primary 
credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate to 75 basis 
points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in the pre-crisis discount 
rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place.  (NOTE:  Vice Chair Yellen was not present for this 
discussion.) 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
