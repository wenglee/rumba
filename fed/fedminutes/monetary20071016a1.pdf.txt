DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Reduction in the primary credit rate from 
6-1/4 percent to 5-3/4 percent.

Approved.
August 16, 2007.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San Francisco had voted on 
August 16, 2007, to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary 
credit program (primary credit rate) of 5-3/4 percent (a reduction from 6-1/4 percent).  
The San Francisco Bank had also voted to renew the formulas for calculating the rates 
applicable to discounts and advances under the secondary and seasonal credit 
programs (secondary and seasonal credit rates).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of St. Louis had voted on August 9 to establish a primary credit rate of 6 percent.  
The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas had voted on August 9 and the directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Minneapolis had voted on August 16 to 
maintain the existing primary credit rate (6-1/4 percent).

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 50-basis-point reduction, and 

the Board approved a reduction in the primary credit rate from 6-1/4 percent to 
5-3/4 percent, effective August 17 for the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San 
Francisco.  The Board also approved the San Francisco Bank's request for renewal of 
the formulas for secondary and seasonal credit rates.

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 
on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 5-3/4 percent, of the Board's approval. 
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining Reserve Banks established that rate and were 
informed of the Board's approval, effective August 17 for the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas 
City, and Dallas and effective August 20 for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.)

Voting for this action:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, and 
                                Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond had voted on September 12, 2007, and the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas had voted on 
September 13 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit 
program (primary credit rate) of 5-1/2 percent (a reduction from 5-3/4 percent).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on September 7, the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and St. Louis had voted on 
September 12, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Minneapolis, 
Kansas City, and San Francisco had voted on September 13 to establish a primary 
credit rate of 5-1/4 percent.  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
had voted on September 6 to maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on September 4, 
the Board had taken no action on a request by the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco to lower the primary credit rate to 5-1/2 percent. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of a 50-basis-point reduction cited 

concerns about increased downside risks to the real economy.  Most directors believed 
that the recent tightening of credit conditions appeared likely to have contractionary 
effects on the economy going forward and that these effects could be significant, partly 
by intensifying the correction in the housing sector.  Some noted that a weak 
employment report for August was perhaps an early sign of a slowdown.  With inflation 
moderating somewhat, these directors supported reducing the primary credit rate to 
5-1/4 percent.

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of reducing the primary credit 

rate by 25 basis points also expressed concern about the near-term prospects for

economic activity, and they generally agreed that inflation risks had diminished a little 
and risks to growth had increased.  These directors believed, however, that a reduction 
in the primary credit rate to 5-1/2 percent was the appropriate adjustment to the stance 
of monetary policy at this time.

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the 

primary credit rate before tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, 
and the existing rate was maintained.

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, 
                                and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond had voted on September 12, 2007, and the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas had voted on 
September 13 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit 
program (primary credit rate) of 5-1/2 percent (a reduction from 5-3/4 percent).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had voted on September 7, the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and St. Louis had voted on 
September 12, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Minneapolis, 
Kansas City, and San Francisco had voted on September 13 to establish a primary 
credit rate of 5-1/4 percent.  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
had voted on September 6 to maintain the existing rate.  At its meeting on 
September 17, the Board had taken no action on the requests to lower the primary 
credit rate.

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 50-basis-point reduction, and 

the Board approved a reduction in the primary credit rate from 5-3/4 percent to 
5-1/4 percent, effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New 
York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, and effective 
September 19 for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Earlier today, the Federal 
Open Market Committee had decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 
50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.  It was understood that a press release announcing the 
reductions in the two rates would be issued.

  In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, 

on their establishment of a primary credit rate of 5-1/4 percent, of the Board's approval.  
(NOTE:  Subsequently, the remaining five Reserve Banks established that rate and 
were informed of the Board's approval, effective September 19 for the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas, and effective September 20 for the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Chicago.)
