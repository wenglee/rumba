Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas had voted on July 24, 
2008, to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate) of 2-1/2 percent (an increase from 2-1/4 percent).  The directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and San 
Francisco had voted on July 24 and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New 
York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis had voted on July 31 to maintain the 

existing rate.  At its meeting on July 21, the Board had taken no action on similar 
requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors in favor of maintaining the existing primary credit 

rate expressed continued concern about the near-term economic outlook.  They noted 
that stress in financial markets and the ongoing housing contraction were likely to damp 
economic growth further in the near term and saw appreciable downside risks to growth. 
However, they also noted that higher energy and food prices could pass through to core 
inflation measures.  These directors concluded that the current stance of monetary 
policy achieved the appropriate balance between downside risks to growth and upside 
risks to inflation, and they preferred for now to monitor incoming information on the 
economy, financial markets, and inflation. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors recommending a 25-basis-point increase in the 

primary credit rate agreed that real economic activity continued to be soft and that 
financial markets had not yet fully stabilized.  However, they cited indications that higher 
input costs were being passed through to product prices and that inflation expectations 
had risen and judged that the upside risks to inflation were of greater concern than the 
downside risks to growth.  These directors concluded that an increase in the primary 
credit rate was appropriate in these circumstances. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be the subject of the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

and Governors Warsh, Kroszner, and Mishkin.
