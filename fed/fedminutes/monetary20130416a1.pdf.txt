Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis,

Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on 
March 14 to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under 
the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve

Bank of Kansas City had voted on March 14 to establish a rate of 1 percent (an 
increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on March 4, the Board had taken no action 
on a similar request by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

In general, Federal Reserve Bank directors said the economy was growing 

moderately.  Many directors noted improvements in the housing sector and business 
investment.  Directors had mixed reports on consumer spending, with some directors 
indicating it had been stronger than expected of late, while other directors cited uneven 
activity across income groups.  The unemployment rate remained elevated, and 
although uncertainty about fiscal matters had abated somewhat, many directors noted 
the damping effect of fiscal policy and increased health care costs on hiring and 
economic growth more broadly.  Overall, directors continued to see downside risks to 
the outlook.  Inflation was generally seen as subdued, and longer-term inflation 
expectations were stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the 
current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, some directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis 

points (to 1 percent) at this time as a step toward restoring the pre-crisis discount rate 
structure.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the primary 
credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target range for 
the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization of the 
primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
