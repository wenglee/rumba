Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco had 
voted on July 28, 2011, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally reported that economic growth had 

been weak in recent months.  Many noted increased uncertainty about the likely pace of 
improvement in the economy over coming quarters, and some pointed to downside risks 
to the outlook.  Most directors observed that consumer spending and sentiment had 
weakened, particularly among middle- to low-income consumers.  Unemployment was 
elevated, and employment prospects remained limited.  Directors also noted the 
ongoing drag on the economy from the still-depressed housing sector, as well as the 
negative effect of uncertainty about European and U.S. fiscal matters.  In general, 
directors said the recent economic slowdown reflected, at least in part, transitory 
factors.  Even after those factors had dissipated, however, directors expected that any 
rebound in growth would likely be weaker than previously thought.  Higher prices for 
energy and other commodities had pushed up inflation earlier this year, but inflation had 
moderated more recently as those prices stabilized or declined.  Longer-term inflation 
expectations had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended 
that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee tomorrow.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained. 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, and Raskin.
