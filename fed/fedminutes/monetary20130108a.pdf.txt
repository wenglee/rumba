Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had 
voted on November 8, 2012, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Minneapolis had voted on November 29, 
2012; the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis had voted on December 5; 
and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on December 6 to reestablish 
the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit 
program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had 
voted on December 6 to establish a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 3/4 percent). 
The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on December 6 to 
establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on 
November 19, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston to decrease and by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 
to increase the primary credit rate. 

In general, Federal Reserve Bank directors remained cautiously optimistic about 
the prospects for economic growth.  Directors noted that changes in economic activity 
across sectors had been mixed.  Many directors pointed to continued improvement in 
the housing sector, including growth in residential construction, although some directors 
reported weakness in the commercial real estate sector.  Directors also reported 

Page  2 

significant home mortgage refinancing activity.  Some directors noted continued, though 
uneven, improvements in consumer spending, especially for automobiles.  Aside from 
the automobile sector, manufacturing was generally described as showing no noticeable 
signs of increased activity, and directors indicated that weak aggregate demand 
continued to contribute to elevated levels of unemployment.  In addition, directors said 
that fiscal and regulatory uncertainty had continued to weigh on business hiring and 
investment, and they expressed increased concern about the potential effects on the 
economy if pending fiscal issues were not addressed.  Additional downside risks 
associated with strains in global markets and with global economic growth more broadly 
were also identified.  Inflation was generally seen as subdued, and longer-term inflation 
expectations remained stable overall.  Against this backdrop, most directors 
recommended that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors favored decreasing the rate by 25 basis points (to 
1/2 percent), while other directors favored increasing the rate by 25 basis points 
(to 1 percent).  In part, directors viewed an increase, which would widen the spread 
between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 75 basis points, as a move toward restoring the 100-basis-point spread in 
the pre-crisis discount rate structure. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place.  (NOTE:  Vice Chair Yellen was not present for this 
discussion.) 

Participating in this determination:  Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chair Yellen, and 

Governors Duke, Tarullo, Raskin, Stein, and Powell.
