DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by twelve Reserve Banks to 
increase the primary credit rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
December 12, 2005. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the 

directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and 
Kansas City had voted on December 1, 2005, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San 
Francisco had voted on December 8 to establish a rate for discounts and advances 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) of 5-1/4 percent (an increase from 
5 percent). 

Directors were generally optimistic about prospects for growth and inflation in 

light of recent favorable data and anecdotal information.  Directors generally perceived 
economic activity as continuing to expand at a healthy pace, with some noting in 
particular the economy’s resilience after recent hurricanes and increases in energy 
prices.  Directors viewed core inflation as remaining relatively moderate and saw few 
signs of rising inflationary pressures.  They pointed out, however, potential upside risks 
to inflation resulting from tightening labor markets and energy prices that remained at 
elevated levels.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank boards of directors recommended an 
increase in the primary credit rate. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 
preliminary basis, their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and its 
communication, which would be the principal subjects of the meeting of the Federal 
Open Market Committee tomorrow.  Against the background of recent and prospective 
economic developments, Board members tentatively favored a further step in the 
process of monetary policy firming and discussed possible modifications to the 
description of the process.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 
rate before the Committee’s meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Increase in the primary credit rate from 
5 percent to 5-1/4 percent. 

Approved. 
December 13, 2005. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the 

directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and 
Kansas City had voted on December 1, 2005, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San 
Francisco had voted on December 8 to establish a rate for discounts and advances 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) of 5-1/4 percent (an increase from 
5 percent).  At its meeting on December 12, the Board had considered, but had taken 
no action on, those requests. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 25-basis-point increase, and the 

Board approved an increase in the primary credit rate from 5 percent to 5-1/4 percent, 
effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San 
Francisco, and effective December 14 for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  At an 
earlier meeting today, the Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase its 
target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent.  It was understood 
that a press release announcing the increases in the two rates would be issued. 
Voting for this action:  Chairman Greenspan, Vice Chairman Ferguson, and 

Governors Bies, Olson, and Kohn.
