September 15, 2014. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, and St. Louis had voted on 
September 4, 2014, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco had voted on 
September 11, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had voted on September 4, and the directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas had voted on September 11, to 
establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on 
August 25, the Board had taken no action on similar requests by the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas to increase the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally anticipated continued moderate 

economic growth.  Directors reported further increases in consumer spending, but some 
directors also cited uneven activity across income groups and ongoing caution on the 
part of consumers.  Other directors noted moderate to strong growth in the 
manufacturing sector, as well as gains in multifamily and nonresidential construction. 
Residential real estate activity remained a concern for some directors.  The 
unemployment rate had been stable recently, but labor market conditions had improved 
somewhat on balance.  Directors generally saw continued slack in labor markets, 

Page  2 

although some firms still reported difficulty finding qualified workers for certain positions. 
Directors did not see an increase in overall price pressures, and longer-term inflation 
expectations had remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended 
that the current primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of their outlook for economic and financial conditions, 
as well as their assessments of the risks to that outlook. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
