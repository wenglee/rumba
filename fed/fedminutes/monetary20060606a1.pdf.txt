DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by nine Reserve Banks to 
increase the primary credit rate; requests by three Reserve Banks to maintain the 
existing rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
May 1, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Minneapolis had voted on April 20, 2006, 
and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on April 27 to establish a rate for 
discounts and advances under the primary credit program (primary credit rate) of 
6 percent (an increase from 5-3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks 
of New York and Philadelphia had voted on April 20 and the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on April 27 to maintain the existing rate. 

Directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate generally viewed recent 

economic data as consistent with healthy growth, a high level of employment, and 
stable inflation.  Other directors, however, considered inflation somewhat higher and 
growth a bit stronger than they had expected.  Overall, the directors agreed that a 

further tightening in monetary policy was appropriate, although several noted that the 
federal funds rate was near the upper end of what could be considered a neutral range. 

Directors in favor of maintaining the current primary credit rate were more 
comfortable with a wait-and-see approach at this time, although some expressed 
support for additional monetary policy tightening if warranted by the available data.

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 

rate, and the existing rate was maintained.

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of

the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, 
and San Francisco had voted on April 27, 2006, and the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis had voted on 
May 4 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate) of 6 percent (an increase from 5-3/4 percent).  At its meeting on 
May 1, the Board had considered, but had taken no action on, similar requests by the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco to increase the primary credit rate. 

The views of directors in favor of increasing the primary credit rate were 

substantially the same as those considered at the Board's meeting on May 1.  Some 
directors additionally noted that consumer activity remained robust despite slowing 
demand in housing and increased prices in the energy, commodities, and agricultural 
sectors. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit 
rate before the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee later this week, and the 
existing rate was maintained.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Increase in the primary credit rate from 
5-3/4 percent to 6 percent. 

Approved. 
May 10, 2006. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, 
and San Francisco had voted on April 27, 2006, and the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis had voted on 
May 4 to establish a rate for discounts and advances under the primary credit program 
(primary credit rate) of 6 percent (an increase from 5-3/4 percent).  At its meeting on 
May 8, the Board had considered, but had taken no action on, the requests to increase 
the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, there was a consensus for a 25-basis-point increase, and the 

Board approved an increase in the primary credit rate from 5-3/4 percent to 6 percent, 
effective immediately for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco, and 
effective May 11 for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  At an earlier meeting today, 
the Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase its target for the federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent.  It was understood that a press release 
announcing the increases in the two rates would be issued. 

In addition, the Secretary was authorized to inform the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Kansas City, on its establishment of a primary credit rate of 6 percent, of the Board's 
approval.  (NOTE:  Subsequently, the Reserve Bank established that rate and was 
informed of the Board's approval, effective May 11, 2006.)
